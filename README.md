# Application Title: Tic-Tac-Toe

This application allows a user to play Tic-Tac-Toe. Users are prompted to sign up and sign in with an email address and password of their choice. Users may start a new game, where they will play against themselves alternating between X's and O's. The application decides the result of the game (win or draw) and then allows the user to start a new game or view how many games they have played. The user also has the ability to change their password and sign out and return to the original login view.
